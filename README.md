This project serves as a prework guide for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with practical examples and explanations.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Linking a Stylesheet

- **HTML**: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
- **Purpose**: This tag links the external CSS file (`styles.css`) to the HTML document, allowing you to apply styles to the webpage.

### 2. Linking an Image and Setting its Size

- **HTML**: `<img src="./image.png" alt="A nice looking waterfall" width="520" height="346">`
- **Purpose**: This tag inserts an image (`image.png`) into the HTML document, sets its alternative text to "A nice looking waterfall," and specifies its width and height.

### 3. Styling the Header and Footer

- **CSS Techniques**:
  - **Background Color**: Changes the background color of the header and footer.
  - **Text Color**: Adjusts the text color within the header and footer.
  - **Text Alignment**: Aligns the text within the header and footer.

### 4. Styling the Main Section for Better Layout

- **CSS Techniques**:
  - **Display Flex**: `display: flex;` is used to create a flexible layout.
  - **Flex Wrap**: `flex-wrap: wrap;` allows items to wrap onto multiple lines.
  - **Justify Content**: `justify-content: space-around;` ensures that items are spaced evenly within the container.

### 5. Using JavaScript to Apply Random Colors to Boxes

- **JavaScript**: The script randomly selects a color and applies it to specific boxes on the page, adding dynamic visual effects.
